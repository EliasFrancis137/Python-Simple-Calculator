# Python-Simple-Calculator

## Overview
This is a **simple command-line calculator** written in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
The calculator runs interactively and continues until the user chooses to exit.  

It is a beginner-friendly project that teaches **input handling**, **conditional statements**, and **loops**.

---

## Features
- Perform **addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)**  
- Handles **division by zero** with an error message  
- Validates operator input and provides feedback for **invalid operators**  
- Interactive loop for multiple calculations without restarting the program

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script:  
   ```bash
   python simple_calculator.py

2. Enter the first number
3. Enter an operator (+, -, *, /)
4. Enter the second number
5.The program displays the result
6.You will be asked if you want to perform another calculation:
  Enter y to continue
  Enter n to exit

## Example
Enter the first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter the second number: 5
Result: 50.0
Do you want to perform another calculation? (y/n): n

Learning Points
Handling user input with input() and type conversion using float()
Using if-elif-else statements for conditional logic
Implementing a while loop for repeating the program
Handling edge cases like division by zero and invalid operators
